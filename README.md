*   Once started the player is now the Mine Hunter
*   The Mine Hunter is presented with a gameboard of 8 x 8 squares (64 squares total)
*   There are 10 mines hidden on the gameboard and the Mine Hunter must destroy all mines in order to win the game

*   Unselected squares are marked with an empty space

*   If incorrect guess is made a - symbol will mark that location. 1 turn will be lost every time this happens.
*   If all mines are destroyed before turns run out then the Mine Hunter will win the game otherwise it will be a loss.
*   At the end of the game an option will be presented to play again. Press Y to play again or press N to end that game session.
